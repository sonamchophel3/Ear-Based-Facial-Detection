# Ear-Based Facial Detection

## Description
Ear-Based Facial Detection is a Python project that uses deep learning techniques to recognize individuals based on ear images. The project includes data loading, preprocessing, and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognition.

## Features
- Load and preprocess ear images.
- Train a CNN for ear-based recognition.
- Predict and display the results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ear-Based-Facial-Detection.git
    cd Ear-Based-Facial-Detection
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Run the `final_solution.py` to train the model and make predictions:
```bash
python final_solution.py
